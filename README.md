# Java BinaryTree Project
# Overview
This Java project implements a binary tree that organizes and processes string labels based on a provided input file. The program constructs the tree by inserting nodes according to specified paths and labels, and then determines the lexicographically last word formed by tracing from the root node to each leaf node. It is an ideal example to understand binary tree operations and string manipulation in Java.

# Features
Binary Tree Construction: Builds a binary tree based on paths and labels specified in an input file.
<br />String Manipulation: Forms words from the root to leaf nodes and evaluates them lexicographically.
<br />File Input: Reads from a file to get the node labels and their insertion paths in the tree.
<br />Output Display: Prints the lexicographically last word formed from the root to any leaf node.

# Requirements
Java JDK 11 or later

# How to Use
Compile the Java program using:
<br />javac Program.java

Run the program by providing the path to your input file as a command-line argument:
<br />java Program path/to/your/file.txt
